2002.04.27 :
In december 2001 we had the need to import cvs data uploaded
by a webbrowser into a sql database. The whole content management 
system we use actually is based on java servlets and JSP files.

So we looked for a CVS driver where we could import the CSV data 
like any other database. After a short search we did find the csvjdbc
driver on sourceforge from Jonathan Ackerman.

The driver this it's job good enough for us, so we where happy.

In february 2002 another of our clients wished to upload data
into our cms in xls format, since they had big problems in
generating standard csv files. (This ca heppen if you use one 
of the major office applications availavle today ;-) )

So we did again a search for a package who could read xls files.
We did not find a jdbc driver who could do this on any platform.
If we where only targeting win32 platforms, then we could have
used the jdbcodbc bridge, but...
So we looked for a library who could at least read xls files
and once more we found something on sourceforge.

So we now had the idea to adapt our cms to use the xlrd libraries.
But after thinking again at what we needed, we did realy fast see
that it would probably be a big gain if we could access the 
xls files via the jdbc interface.

So we did decide to put our efforts into writing a xls jdbc driver
instead of enhancing our cms with the xlrd libraries.

After a relay short time we had the merger between the csvjdbc and
the xlrd libraries done. So the xlsjdbc driver worked very good.

And since the parent cvsjdbc project is LGPL we decided to put
our work in LGPL too.
